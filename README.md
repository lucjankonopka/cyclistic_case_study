## Abstract
Following case study was completed by Lucjan Konopka as part of the [Google Data Analytics Certificate](https://www.credly.com/badges/d8457d2e-06e4-4142-8ea1-4cfd52f24c67/linked_in_profile). 
Datasets used to perform this analysis relates to the fictional company Cyclistic and has been made available by Motivate International Inc. 
This datasets is public and contains only non-personal information about share-bike rides in Chicago.
Data from *October 2021 to September 2022* were used for the analysis.

*Python* and its *pandas* library were used to clean and prepare the data to the analysis. 
All calculations and visualizations were carried out using the *pandas*, *matplotlib*, *numpy* and *seaborn* libraries.

The result of the project are marketing strategies supported by the conclusions of the analysis.

## Task description

Source: [*Cyclistic-Case-Study-Task-Description.pdf*](https://github.com/lucjankonopka/cyclistic_case_study/blob/main/Cyclistic-Case-Study-Task-Description.pdf) 

Cyclistic is a successful bike-share offering with the fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. 
The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.
It offers various pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. 
Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. 
Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. 
The clear goal has been set: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. 

In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. 
The main task is to analyse the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.

## Data cleaning process

The whole data cleaning process was performed using pandas library [*cyclistic_data_cleaning.py*](https://github.com/lucjankonopka/cyclistic_case_study/blob/main/cyclistic_data_cleaning.py).

The documentation of the process is included in the file [*Data_cleaning_process.ipynb*](https://github.com/lucjankonopka/cyclistic_case_study/blob/main/Data_cleaning_process.ipynb).

## Analysis

The process of processing, analyzing and creating visualisations was performed file  [*cyclistic_calc.py*](https://github.com/lucjankonopka/cyclistic_case_study/blob/main/cyclistic_calc.py).

All visualisations and conclusions have been compiled in the presentation [*How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success.pdf*](https://github.com/lucjankonopka/cyclistic_case_study/blob/main/How%20Does%20a%20Bike-Share%20%20Navigate%20Speedy%20Success.pdf).

## Summary

The analysis of the historical rides data from October 2021 to September 2022 allowed to create a marketing strategy to help convert casual users into annual users.
